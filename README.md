This project is a little proxy that forwards my REST requests I receive from my rating participants and converts them to JSON which is then transferred to my laptop (which I use to present). This can then do with the ratings whatever it wants, in my case control lights in the room and change their color depending on the ratings received by the participants. 

Here you can find the "client" code
